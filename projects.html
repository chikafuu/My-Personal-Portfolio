          <h3>2D Maze Game (I need Sleep)</h3>
          <p>In our first year of Computer Programming I, under the guidance of Sir Ellom,<br>
          we created our very first 2D game using Greenfoot IDE with Java.<br>
          It was our introduction to game development and object-oriented programming concepts.

          <h3>POS for our dear client: Croffle Coquette</h3>
          <p>We created a simple Point of Sale (POS) system using Python for our client who sells croffles and other items.
            This system is especially helpful for their business, as they were previously relying on manual records of sales and receipts. 
            Now, they can input orders, calculate totals automatically, and print receipts — saving time and reducing errors.

          <h3>Health appointment system</h3>
          <p>We created the Global Care System using Java and NetBeans IDE with a MySQL database.
            This system allows users to book appointments, while doctors and admins can sign in to manage their schedules.
            They can view appointment slots, print receipts, and manage the online pharmacy — including entering, updating, or deleting medicine inventory data.
